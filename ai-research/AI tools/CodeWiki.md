# CodeWiki

## Context

Blog -  #web_site https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-code-wiki-accelerating-your-code-understanding/

**A new way to understand code**

At Google, our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. For developers, that means unlocking the vital knowledge currently buried in complex source code.

We built a system that fulfills this mission by keeping documentation alive. Instead of static files, it maintains a continuously updated, structured wiki for every repository.

1. **Automated & always up-to-date:** Code Wiki scans the full codebase and regenerates the documentation after each change. The docs evolve with the code.
2. **Intelligent & context-aware:** The entire, always-current wiki serves as the knowledge base for an integrated chat. You’re not talking to a generic model, but to one that knows your repo end-to-end.
3. **Integrated & actionable:** Every wiki section and chat answer is hyper-linked directly to the relevant code files and definitions. Reading and exploring merge into one workflow.
