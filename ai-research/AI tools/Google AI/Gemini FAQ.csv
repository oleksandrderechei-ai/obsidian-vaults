"What is Google Gemini?","Gemini is Google's most capable multimodal AI model family, designed to understand and generate text, code, images, audio, and video. It comes in three sizes: Ultra (largest), Pro (balanced), and Nano (on-device).","General"
"What are the differences between Gemini model sizes?","Gemini Ultra is the largest model for highly complex tasks. Gemini Pro is optimized for scaling across a wide range of tasks. Gemini Nano is designed for on-device tasks on mobile and edge devices.","Models"
"How do I access Gemini API?","Access Gemini through Google AI Studio for prototyping or Vertex AI for production. You need a Google Cloud account and API key. Free tier available with rate limits; paid plans offer higher quotas.","API Access"
"What is Google AI Studio?","Google AI Studio is a free, web-based IDE for prototyping with Gemini models. It allows prompt design, testing, and API key generation. Ideal for developers starting with Gemini before moving to production.","Tools"
"What are Gemini Gems?","Gems are custom AI assistants you can create in Gemini Advanced. They allow you to define specific instructions, personality, and expertise areas for specialized tasks without repeated prompting.","Features"
"What context window does Gemini support?","Gemini 1.5 Pro supports up to 2 million tokens context window—the largest among major LLMs. This enables processing of entire codebases, long documents, or hours of video in a single prompt.","Technical"
"How does Gemini handle multimodal inputs?","Gemini natively processes text, images, audio, and video in a single model. You can combine modalities in prompts—for example, asking questions about images or analyzing video content with text queries.","Technical"
"What is Gemini Advanced?","Gemini Advanced is Google's premium subscription tier ($19.99/month with Google One AI Premium) providing access to Gemini Ultra, larger context windows, Gems, and priority access to new features.","Pricing"
"How does Gemini compare to GPT-4?","Gemini Ultra matches or exceeds GPT-4 on most benchmarks. Key advantages include larger context window (2M vs 128K tokens), native multimodal understanding, and tighter Google Workspace integration.","Comparison"
"What are Gemini's safety features?","Gemini includes built-in safety filters, content policies, and harm prevention mechanisms. Enterprise users can configure safety settings. Google applies RLHF and constitutional AI methods to reduce harmful outputs.","Safety"
"Can I use Gemini for commercial applications?","Yes. Gemini API through Vertex AI is available for commercial use with enterprise-grade SLAs, data privacy guarantees, and no training on customer data. Review Google's terms of service for specific use cases.","Commercial Use"
"What programming languages does Gemini support for code generation?","Gemini excels at Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, and most major languages. It can generate, explain, debug, and refactor code, with strong performance on competitive programming benchmarks.","Code"
"How do I use Gemini in Google Workspace?","Gemini is integrated into Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Meet through Duet AI (now Gemini for Workspace). It assists with drafting, summarizing, data analysis, and meeting transcription.","Integration"
"What are Gemini's rate limits?","Free tier: 60 requests/minute for Gemini Pro. Paid Vertex AI: configurable quotas based on your plan. Rate limits vary by model size and endpoint. Check Google Cloud console for current limits.","API Access"
"Does Gemini support function calling?","Yes. Gemini supports function calling (tool use) allowing the model to generate structured JSON to call external APIs or functions. This enables building agents and integrating with external systems.","Technical"
