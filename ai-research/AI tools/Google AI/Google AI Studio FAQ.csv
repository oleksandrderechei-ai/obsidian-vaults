Question,Answer,Tag
"What is Google AI Studio?","Google AI Studio is a free, browser-based IDE for prototyping and experimenting with Gemini models. It provides prompt design tools, model testing, and API key generation without requiring coding.","General"
"Is Google AI Studio free?","Yes. Google AI Studio is completely free to use with generous rate limits. It's designed for prototyping and learning. For production workloads with higher quotas, use Vertex AI.","Pricing"
"How do I get started with AI Studio?","Visit aistudio.google.com, sign in with your Google account. You can immediately start prompting Gemini models, create structured prompts, and generate API keys for development.","Getting Started"
"What models are available in AI Studio?","AI Studio provides access to Gemini Pro, Gemini Pro Vision, Gemini Ultra (with Gemini Advanced), and experimental models. Model availability may vary by region and account type.","Models"
"What is a Freeform prompt?","Freeform prompts are simple text inputs where you interact with Gemini conversationally. Ideal for quick experiments, brainstorming, and testing model responses without structured formatting.","Prompt Types"
"What is a Structured prompt?","Structured prompts let you define input/output examples in a table format. The model learns from your examples to generate consistent responses. Great for classification, extraction, or formatting tasks.","Prompt Types"
"What is a Chat prompt?","Chat prompts simulate multi-turn conversations. You define system instructions and example exchanges. The model maintains context across turns, ideal for building conversational AI prototypes.","Prompt Types"
"How do I get an API key?","Click 'Get API key' in AI Studio. You can create a new key or use an existing one from your Google Cloud project. Keys are free but have rate limits for prototyping use.","API"
"What are the rate limits in AI Studio?","Free tier: 60 requests/minute for Gemini Pro, 15 requests/minute for multimodal. Limits are per-project. Check the AI Studio dashboard for current quotas and usage.","Limits"
"Can I use AI Studio for production?","AI Studio is designed for prototyping, not production. For production workloads, migrate to Vertex AI which offers enterprise SLAs, higher quotas, and advanced features.","Best Practices"
"How do I test multimodal prompts?","Switch to Gemini Pro Vision or a multimodal model. Upload images directly in the prompt interface. You can combine text and images to test vision understanding capabilities.","Multimodal"
"Can I export prompts from AI Studio?","Yes. Click 'Get code' to export your prompt as Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, or Swift code. This generates ready-to-use API calls for integration into your applications.","Features"
"What is the System Instruction feature?","System instructions set the model's behavior, persona, and constraints before user interaction. Define tone, expertise, output format, and safety guidelines that persist across the conversation.","Features"
"How do I tune model parameters?","Adjust Temperature (creativity), Top-K, Top-P (diversity), and Max Output Tokens in the settings panel. Lower temperature = more deterministic; higher = more creative responses.","Technical"
"Does AI Studio save my prompts?","Yes. Prompts are saved to your Google account and accessible across devices. You can organize, rename, and delete saved prompts. Review Google's data policies for retention details.","Privacy"
