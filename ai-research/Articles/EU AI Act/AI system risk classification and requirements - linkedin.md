Your AI might already be illegal.

Since February 2025, eight categories of AI systems are banned in the EU. No transition period. No warnings.

But here's what I keep seeing developers get wrong:

They think the EU AI Act is about banning AI. It's not. It's about classifying it.

Get it right? Compliance becomes manageable.

Get it wrong? Costly retrofitting, market exclusion, or worse.

The four-tier system:

🔴 Unacceptable Risk — Banned. Full stop.

🟠 High Risk — Conformity assessments, human oversight required.

🟡 Limited Risk — Transparency disclosures only.

🟢 Minimal Risk — No mandatory requirements.

What's already illegal since Feb 2025?

- Social scoring systems
- Emotion recognition at work or school
- Scraping the internet for facial recognition databases
- Subliminal manipulation that causes harm
- Biometric categorization by race, religion, or politics

And if you're building for hiring, credit scoring, healthcare, or law enforcement — you're likely in High-Risk territory.

The good news? Most AI falls into "Minimal Risk."

But here's the catch:

- You're responsible for classifying your own system
- You must document your assessment before market entry
- If you can't produce documentation when asked — expect immediate intervention
