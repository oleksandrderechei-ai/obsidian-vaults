"What are the four risk categories under the EU AI Act?","Unacceptable Risk (prohibited), High Risk (strictly regulated), Limited Risk (transparency obligations), and Minimal/No Risk (unregulated). Classification determines compliance requirements and market access.","Risk Classification, Priority High"
"How do I know if my AI system is high-risk?","Check two tracks: (1) Annex I—is it a safety component of a regulated product like medical devices or machinery? (2) Annex III—does it fall under sensitive areas like biometrics, employment, education, critical infrastructure, law enforcement, migration, or justice?","Risk Classification, Priority High"
"What happens if I misclassify my AI system?","Misclassification leads to significant ROI loss through late-stage compliance retrofitting and potential market exclusion. If you classify as 'Minimal' when it meets 'High-Risk' criteria, you face regulatory penalties and may need to halt market operations.","Risk Classification, Priority High"
"What AI practices are completely banned?","Eight practices are prohibited since Feb 2025: social scoring, subliminal manipulation, exploitation of vulnerabilities, predictive policing (profiling-only), untargeted facial scraping, emotion recognition at work/school, biometric categorization by sensitive attributes, and real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces.","Prohibited AI, Priority High"
"Is facial recognition completely banned?","No. Real-time remote biometric identification (RBI) in public spaces is prohibited for law enforcement, but exceptions exist for serious threats (missing persons, terrorism, serious crimes). These require FRIA, judicial authorization, and EU database registration. Non-real-time and private use cases have different rules.","Prohibited AI, Priority High"
"Can I use emotion recognition AI in my company?","Emotion recognition in workplaces is prohibited under Article 5, unless used for strictly medical or safety reasons. Educational institutions have the same restriction. Violation carries maximum fines of €35M or 7% of global turnover.","Prohibited AI, Priority High"
"What are the compliance requirements for high-risk AI?","Mandatory conformity assessment, registration in EU database, human oversight mechanisms, risk management system, technical documentation, quality management system, and post-market monitoring. Some categories require third-party notified body involvement.","High-Risk AI, Priority High"
"Can my high-risk AI system avoid strict regulation?","Under Article 6(3), an Annex III system may escape the 'High-Risk' label if it doesn't pose significant risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights. However, the provider bears the burden of proof and must document this assessment before market entry.","High-Risk AI, Priority Medium"
"What if my AI system performs profiling?","Any Annex III system performing profiling (automated processing of personal data to assess aspects of a person's life) is ALWAYS classified as high-risk with no derogation possible. This is a 'red line' trigger.","High-Risk AI, Priority High"
"What is General-Purpose AI under the EU AI Act?","GPAI models are 'building blocks' capable of performing wide-ranging tasks they weren't specifically designed for (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini). They're regulated based on 'inherent capability' rather than 'intended purpose.'","GPAI, Priority Medium"
"When is a GPAI model considered to have systemic risk?","GPAI models are presumed to have systemic risk if training compute exceeds 10²⁵ FLOPs, or if they possess 'high-impact capabilities' like lowering barriers for weapons development or enabling large-scale cyberattacks.","GPAI, Priority High"
"Are open-source AI models exempt from the EU AI Act?","Partially. Open-source models are exempt from technical documentation requirements under Article 53(1)(a) and (b). However, copyright policy and training summary obligations still apply. The exemption vanishes entirely if the model is deemed to have systemic risk.","GPAI, Priority Medium"
"What are the maximum fines under the EU AI Act?","Up to €35M or 7% of global annual turnover for prohibited practices. High-risk non-compliance can result in €15M or 3% of turnover. Providing incorrect information to authorities: €7.5M or 1% of turnover.","Fines & Enforcement, Priority High"
"Who enforces the EU AI Act?","National market surveillance authorities in each EU member state, coordinated by the European AI Office. The AI Office also directly supervises GPAI providers and can impose fines for GPAI-specific violations.","Fines & Enforcement, Priority Medium"
"When did the EU AI Act prohibitions take effect?","Prohibitions on Unacceptable Risk AI (Article 5) became active on February 2, 2025. This includes bans on social scoring, subliminal manipulation, and real-time RBI in public spaces.","Timeline, Priority High"
"What is the full EU AI Act implementation timeline?","Feb 2025: Prohibitions active. Aug 2025: Governance rules and GPAI obligations apply. Aug 2026: Full application for Annex III High-Risk systems. Aug 2027: Full application for High-Risk systems in Annex I regulated products.","Timeline, Priority High"
"How does the EU AI Act compare to US regulations?","The EU takes a prescriptive, risk-based mandatory approach. The US under the 'Trump AI Reset' (2025) favors innovation-first with a $500B infrastructure project and 'Preventing Woke AI' Executive Order mandating ideological neutrality for federal procurement.","Global Context, Priority Medium"
"What is the UK's approach to AI regulation?","The UK rejected an EU-style AI Bill, positioning as a 'Third Pillar.' The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) diverges from GDPR, favoring agile, sector-led supervision rather than horizontal prescriptive regulation.","Global Context, Priority Medium"
"What should organizations prioritize for EU AI Act compliance?","1) Conduct AI system inventory and risk classification. 2) Implement conformity assessments for high-risk systems. 3) Establish human oversight mechanisms. 4) Build documentation and quality management systems. 5) Register high-risk systems in EU database.","Compliance Strategy, Priority High"
"How do I handle regulatory differences between EU and US?","Build global AI governance principles but tailor regional controls. Track divergence between EU prescription and US deregulation. Strengthen internal data classification frameworks. Factor in geopolitics—EU fines may face retaliatory trade measures.","Compliance Strategy, Priority Medium"
