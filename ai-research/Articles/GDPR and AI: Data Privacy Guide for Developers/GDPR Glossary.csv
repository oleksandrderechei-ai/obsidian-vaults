"GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)","A comprehensive European Union regulation focused on data protection and privacy for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area.","Enacted in 2018, it aims to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe and empowers individuals to control their personal data. It imposes strict obligations on data controllers and processors regarding data security, breach notifications, and the lawful transfer of data across borders."
"EU AI Act","The world's first comprehensive legal framework specifically designed to regulate artificial intelligence systems based on their potential risk levels.","The act classifies AI into four risk categories: unacceptable (prohibited), high-risk (regulated), limited risk (transparency obligations), and minimal risk. It imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers, particularly for high-risk systems used in critical infrastructure, education, and law enforcement."
"TFAIA (Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act)","A landmark California law (Senate Bill 53) aimed at enhancing transparency, safety, and accountability for developers of advanced AI frontier models.","The act introduces obligations for developers to manage catastrophic risks, which are defined as risks resulting in death, serious injury to more than 50 people, or over USD 1 billion in property damage. It mandates the public posting of risk management frameworks, incident reporting to the Office of Emergency Services, and establishes whistleblower protections."
"General Purpose AI (GPAI)","An AI model or system designed to perform a wide range of distinct tasks and capable of integration into various downstream applications.","Under the EU AI Act, GPAI providers must maintain technical documentation, comply with copyright laws, and publish summaries of training data. Models that use compute power greater than 10²⁵ FLOPs are classified as having systemic risk and face additional requirements like adversarial testing."
"Frontier Model","An advanced foundation AI model trained using more than 10²⁶ computational operations, as defined by the TFAIA.","These models are subject to specific safety and transparency requirements under California law because of their high capabilities. Entities that train these models are referred to as 'frontier developers,' with additional burdens placed on those exceeding USD 500 million in annual revenue."
"DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)","A mandatory assessment under Article 35 of the GDPR for processing activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.","It is used to identify and mitigate privacy risks early in the project lifecycle, particularly for new technologies like AI. For high-risk AI systems, the EU AI Act suggests using information from conformity assessments to inform the DPIA process."
"Digital Omnibus","A 2025 European Commission legislative proposal intended to streamline and harmonize various digital acts, including the GDPR and the EU AI Act.","The initiative aims to reduce administrative burdens and bureaucracy for businesses by clarifying definitions and aligning reporting requirements. Key proposals include a single-entry point for breach reporting and updated definitions for personal data based on CJEU rulings."
"Pseudonymization","A data protection technique that replaces private identifiers with artificial identifiers or pseudonyms to prevent direct identification of individuals.","Under the proposed Digital Omnibus, data treated this way may not be subject to GDPR if the controller is unable to re-identify the individual. It allows organizations to derive insights from large datasets while maintaining a layer of security for the data subjects."
"Whistleblower Protection","Legal safeguards preventing retaliation against employees who report violations or dangers to public health and safety.","The TFAIA specifically protects AI model risk managers and employees who disclose information regarding substantial dangers or violations of the act. Large developers are required to provide anonymous internal reporting processes and updates to these individuals."
"CalCompute","A public cloud computing cluster initiative established by California law to support safe and ethical AI research.","Managed by a consortium of academic, labor, and technical experts, the goal is to foster equitable AI innovation. The initiative is contingent on budgetary appropriations and requires a comprehensive report to be submitted to the legislature by 2027."
