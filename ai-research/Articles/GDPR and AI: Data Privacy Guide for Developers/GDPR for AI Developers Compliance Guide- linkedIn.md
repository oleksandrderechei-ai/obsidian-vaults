€1.2 billion.

That's what Meta paid for getting GDPR wrong.

Amazon? €746 million.

If you're building AI systems that touch personal data in 2026, this isn't a "nice to know" anymore. It's survival.

Here's the problem most developers face:

There are now TWO laws governing your AI projects — and they work differently.

𝗚𝗗𝗣𝗥 controls how you handle data.
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗨 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗰𝘁 controls the AI system itself.

Miss one, and you're exposed.

But here's what nobody tells you:

Your LLM probably doesn't achieve true anonymization. Training data can be reconstructed. "Memorized" by the model.

That means GDPR still applies — even when you think you've cleaned your dataset.

And users now have enforceable rights you must build into your system:

→ The right to an explanation when AI makes decisions about them
→ The right to delete their data from your trained models
→ The right to export their data in machine-readable format
→ 30 days to respond. Or face penalties.

The good news? The 2025 "Digital Omnibus" just made things easier:

✅ Legitimate interest is now explicitly valid for AI training

✅ Pseudonymized data gets clearer legal treatment

✅ New exemption for using sensitive data to detect bias

✅ Breach notification extended from 72 to 96 hours

I've put together a complete guide covering:

• The two lawful bases that actually work for AI
• Implementation checklist for user rights endpoints
• How GDPR and the EU AI Act complement each other
• Phase-by-phase compliance from planning to deployment
• Every change coming in 2026

No legalese. Just developer-ready guidance.

What's been your biggest challenge with GDPR in AI projects? I'd love to hear in the comments.
