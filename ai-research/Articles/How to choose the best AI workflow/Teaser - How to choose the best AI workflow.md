**How to choose the best AI workflow**
*Choosing the Right Tool: Prompts vs. Projects vs. Agents vs. Agentic AI*

- ***Start simple*** — start with the simplest tool that solves the problem. First try simple chat with LLM, if that is not enough, — use structured prompts.
- ***Apply 80/20 Rule*** most of recurring tasks, can be solved with structured prompts. 
- ***Automate repetitive or dynamic tasks*** — for static tasks create a project (Gemini Gem, Chat GPT projects, etc.) is good enough, when task is dynamic, then you need to setup an agent.

**Your Action Plan**
1. Audit your current AI tasks.
2. Move recurring prompts into Projects.
3. Only explore Agents if the task requires live data, tool usage, or unpredictable reasoning paths.
