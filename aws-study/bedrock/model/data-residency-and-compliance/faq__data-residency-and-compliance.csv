Question,Answer,Tags
"What is the difference between AWS-sold and vendor-sold models?","AWS-sold models (Nova, Titan, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) use standard AWS terms with no additional EULA. Model providers have NO access to AWS infrastructure, prompts, or completions. Vendor-sold models (Claude, Twelve Labs, Writer) require accepting the vendor's EULA and may have additional data processing terms.","Data-Privacy,Licensing"
"Does my data leave AWS when using Bedrock?","No. For AWS-sold models, all inference happens within AWS infrastructure. Model providers don't have any access to the Model Deployment Accounts - these are owned and operated by the Amazon Bedrock service team.","Data-Privacy,Security"
"Does Anthropic have access to my Claude prompts on Bedrock?","No. According to Anthropic's commercial terms: 'Anthropic may not train models on Customer Content from Services.' Customer retains all rights, title, and interest in inputs and outputs.","Data-Privacy,Anthropic"
"What metadata does AWS share with Mistral?","AWS may share: AWS Account ID, region, model ID, request count, token usage, timestamps. NOT shared: prompts, completions, or any content you send/receive. Your content is explicitly excluded.","Data-Privacy,Mistral"
"Which models are recommended for strictest EU compliance (GDPR + EU-AI-Act + ISO-42001)?","Amazon Nova, Anthropic Claude, and Mistral AI. These providers have EU entities, comprehensive DPAs, and strong data protection terms.","GDPR,EU-AI-Act"
"Does Anthropic have an EU entity for GDPR purposes?","Yes. Anthropic Ireland, Limited handles EEA/Switzerland/UK customers. The governing law is 'Laws of Ireland' for EU customers. Anthropic also provides an explicit DPA with Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).","GDPR,Anthropic"
"Is Mistral AI GDPR-compliant?","Yes. Mistral AI is a Paris, France-based company (GDPR-native). It's AWS-sold, so no content is shared. Use AWS DPA for coverage.","GDPR,Mistral"
"Can I use DeepSeek models for EU-regulated workloads?","DeepSeek is AWS-sold with no vendor data access, but models are developed by Hangzhou DeepSeek AI (China). Some organizations may have policy restrictions on China-origin AI models. Confirm with your compliance team.","GDPR,DeepSeek"
"What are the concerns with MiniMax and Moonshot AI models?","Both are China-based providers with vendor-sold models. Data processing terms are not explicitly documented. Request explicit DPAs and verify organizational China-origin policy compliance before use.","Data-Privacy,China"
"Are Hugging-Face models available on Bedrock?","No. Hugging-Face models are NOT directly available in Amazon Bedrock. Use SageMaker JumpStart or SageMaker Inference for HF model deployment with AWS DPA coverage.","Deployment,Hugging-Face"
"Is GPT-4 available on Amazon Bedrock?","No. Only open-source GPT-OSS variants (gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b, Safeguard models) are available on Bedrock. For GPT-4/GPT-4o/ChatGPT, use OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI.","Model-Availability,OpenAI"
"What DPA should I use for AWS-sold models?","Use the AWS Data Processing Addendum (DPA) for all AWS-sold models (Nova, Titan, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Gemma, NVIDIA NeMo, GPT-OSS). No separate vendor DPA is needed.","GDPR,DPA"
"What encryption does Bedrock use for data protection?","Data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+. All data is encrypted at rest. You can use Customer Managed Keys (AWS KMS) for additional control.","Security,Encryption"
"Does AWS use my prompts to train foundation models?","No. AWS explicitly states: 'Amazon Bedrock doesn't use your prompts and completions to train any AWS models' and 'doesn't distribute them to third parties.'","Data-Privacy,Training"
"What are the gaps with Twelve Labs and Writer AI for EU compliance?","Both have strong data terms (no vendor access, no training on data, customer owns outputs), BUT: US governing law (California), no EU entity, and no explicit DPA referenced. Request DPA for EU compliance.","GDPR,Twelve-Labs,Writer"
"How does Bedrock support EU-AI-Act requirements?","Bedrock supports: Risk Management (Guardrails, Evaluations), Data Governance (no training on customer data), Technical Documentation, Record-Keeping (CloudTrail, CloudWatch), Transparency (Model Cards), Human Oversight (Guardrails, approval workflows), and Accuracy testing (Model Evaluation).","EU-AI-Act,Compliance"
"Which providers are EU-AI-Act ready?","Amazon, Anthropic, and Mistral have strong readiness with comprehensive documentation, safety features, and transparency. Meta and NVIDIA are good. Others require individual assessment.","EU-AI-Act"
"What is ISO/IEC 42001:2023 and how does Bedrock support it?","ISO/IEC 42001:2023 establishes requirements for an AI Management System (AIMS). Bedrock supports it through: Model Evaluation, Guardrails, CloudWatch/CloudTrail monitoring, API controls, version management, and comprehensive documentation.","ISO-42001,Compliance"
"Can Meta train on my Llama prompts in Bedrock?","No. Llama models are AWS-sold. Meta has zero access to prompts, completions, or AWS infrastructure. Data stays 100% in AWS.","Data-Privacy,Meta"
"What jurisdiction applies to Anthropic Claude for non-EU customers?","California (US) law applies to non-EU/Switzerland/UK customers. EU customers are governed by Laws of Ireland.","Licensing,Jurisdiction"
"Does NVIDIA have access to my NeMo prompts?","No. NVIDIA NeMo models are AWS-sold. NVIDIA has zero access to prompts, completions, or AWS infrastructure. Use AWS DPA for coverage.","Data-Privacy,NVIDIA"
