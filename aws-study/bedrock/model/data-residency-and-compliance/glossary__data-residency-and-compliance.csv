EU AI Act,EU regulation for AI system risk classification,"EU regulation 2024/1689 establishing rules for AI systems based on risk classification: prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, and minimal-risk. Requires transparency, documentation, and human oversight for high-risk systems."
ISO/IEC 42001:2023,International standard for AI management systems,"International standard specifying requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an AI Management System (AIMS). Covers organizational context, leadership, planning, support, operations, performance evaluation, and improvement."
EULA (End User License Agreement),Contract defining software/model usage terms,"Legal agreement between licensor and user defining terms of use, restrictions, acceptable use policies, and liabilities for software or AI models. Required for vendor-sold models on Bedrock."
Data Residency,Geographic data storage and processing requirement,"Compliance requirement that data must be stored and processed within specific geographic boundaries (e.g., EU-only, single region). Critical for GDPR and sector-specific regulations."
High-Risk AI System,EU AI Act classification requiring conformity assessment,"AI system classified under EU AI Act as high-risk, requiring conformity assessment, technical documentation, human oversight, and risk management. Examples: employment decisions, credit scoring, law enforcement."
Model Card,Documentation of model characteristics and limitations,"Structured documentation describing a model's intended use cases, performance metrics, known limitations, training data characteristics, and ethical considerations. Required for transparency under EU AI Act."
Guardrails,AWS Bedrock content filtering and safety controls,"AWS Bedrock feature enabling content filtering, topic blocking, PII detection, and safety controls on model inputs and outputs. Supports EU AI Act human oversight requirements."
Cross-region Inference,Processing requests across multiple AWS regions,"AWS Bedrock feature routing requests across up to 3 regions (us-east-2, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1) for increased throughput and auto-failover. May impact strict data residency requirements."
Model Deployment Account,AWS-managed account hosting foundation models,"AWS-owned and operated account in each Bedrock region containing deployed foundation models. Model providers have no access to these accounts, ensuring data isolation."
Metadata Sharing,Non-content usage information shared with vendors,"Usage telemetry shared with some vendors (e.g., Mistral): AWS Account ID, region, model ID, request count, token usage, timestamps. Does NOT include prompts, completions, or content."
BAA (Business Associate Agreement),HIPAA-required agreement for PHI handling,"Agreement required under HIPAA when a service provider handles Protected Health Information (PHI). Defines responsibilities for safeguarding PHI."
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP),Terms defining prohibited model usage,"Policy defining prohibited uses of AI models, such as generating harmful content, illegal activities, or violating third-party rights. Required compliance for most Bedrock models."
Data Controller,Entity determining data processing purposes,"Under GDPR, the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. Typically the customer using Bedrock for their applications."
Data Processor,Entity processing data on controller's behalf,"Under GDPR, the entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. AWS acts as processor for Bedrock services under the AWS DPA."
Conformity Assessment,EU AI Act compliance verification process,"Process required under EU AI Act for high-risk AI systems to verify compliance with requirements including risk management, data governance, documentation, and transparency."
CloudTrail,AWS audit logging service,"AWS service providing governance, compliance, and audit logging for AWS account activity. Records API calls and events for Bedrock usage, supporting EU AI Act record-keeping requirements."
CloudWatch,AWS monitoring and observability service,"AWS service for monitoring applications, responding to performance changes, and optimizing resource utilization. Used for Bedrock operational monitoring and ISO 42001 performance evaluation."
Bedrock Evaluations,Model testing and assessment feature,"AWS Bedrock capability for testing model accuracy, bias, safety, and performance. Supports EU AI Act accuracy requirements and ISO 42001 AI system impact assessment."
SageMaker JumpStart,AWS ML model deployment service,"AWS service for deploying pre-trained ML models including Hugging Face models. Alternative to Bedrock for models not directly available, covered by AWS DPA."
Human-in-the-loop,Human oversight in AI decision-making,"Practice of involving human review in AI system outputs, especially for high-stakes decisions. Required under EU AI Act for high-risk AI systems and supported by Bedrock Guardrails."
TLS 1.2,Transport Layer Security encryption protocol,"Cryptographic protocol for secure data transmission. All Bedrock data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2, ensuring confidentiality during API calls."
Limited-Risk AI System,EU AI Act category requiring transparency,"AI systems under EU AI Act requiring specific transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots must disclose AI nature). Less stringent than high-risk but still regulated."
Minimal-Risk AI System,EU AI Act category with no specific requirements,"AI systems under EU AI Act posing minimal risk, subject only to voluntary codes of conduct. Examples: spam filters, AI-enabled video games."
Prohibited AI System,EU AI Act category for banned AI applications,"AI systems banned under EU AI Act due to unacceptable risk: social scoring, real-time biometric identification in public spaces, manipulation techniques, exploitation of vulnerabilities."
Open License,Permissive model usage license,"License allowing broad use, modification, and distribution of AI models with minimal restrictions. Examples: Meta Llama Community License, Apache 2.0, MIT. Enables commercial use on Bedrock."
China-origin Model,AI model developed by China-based company,"Foundation model created by companies headquartered in China (e.g., DeepSeek, MiniMax, Moonshot AI, Qwen). May require additional organizational policy review regardless of AWS hosting."
