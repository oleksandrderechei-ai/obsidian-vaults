Term,Summary,Description
"EULA","End User License Agreement","A legal contract between the software provider and the end user that specifies the terms under which the software can be used. Required for vendor-sold models like Claude, Cohere in Bedrock."
"DPA","Data Processing Addendum","A legal agreement ensuring GDPR compliance for data processing. Anthropic provides DPA through Anthropic Ireland Limited for EEA customers."
"AWS-sold models","Models sold directly by AWS","Models like Amazon Nova, Titan, Meta Llama, Mistral that use standard AWS service terms. No additional EULA required, no vendor data access."
"Vendor-sold models","Models sold by third-party providers","Models like Anthropic Claude, Cohere that require accepting the vendor's EULA. May have additional data processing terms and use case submissions."
"Proprietary Commercial License","Closed-source commercial license","License type used by Claude, GPT-4, Cohere. Typically restricts training competitive models, requires compliance with vendor terms. Commercial use allowed."
"Open-Source License","Community or permissive license","License type for Llama (Meta Community License), Mistral (Apache 2.0). Allows fine-tuning and deployment with attribution. Check specific restrictions."
"Apache 2.0","Permissive open-source license","Popular license used by Mistral models. Allows commercial use, modification, distribution with attribution. No copyleft requirements."
"Data Residency","Geographic location of data processing","Requirement that data must be processed and stored in specific geographic regions. Critical for GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory compliance."
"Model Access","Bedrock feature to enable models","AWS Bedrock console section where you request and enable access to foundation models. Some models require EULA acceptance or use case submission."
"Fine-tuning","Customizing a model with your data","Training a pre-trained model on your specific dataset to improve performance for your use case. Licensing terms may restrict fine-tuning usage."
"PrivateLink","AWS VPC private connectivity","AWS service that provides private connectivity between VPCs and AWS services without traversing the public internet. Enhances data isolation."
"BAA","Business Associate Agreement","HIPAA-required agreement between a covered entity and a business associate. Required for healthcare data processing. Cross-region may break BAA compliance."
"GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation","EU regulation governing data protection and privacy. Requires data residency controls, DPA agreements, and lawful basis for processing personal data."
"HIPAA","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act","US law protecting sensitive patient health information. Requires BAA, restricts cross-region data transfer, mandates specific security controls."
"CCPA","California Consumer Privacy Act","California state law giving consumers control over personal information. Requires customer notification for cross-region data transfers."
"Cross-region inference","Multi-region model deployment","Bedrock feature that routes requests across multiple regions for higher throughput and availability. Trade-off: data may process in any configured region."
"Single-region deployment","Region-locked model access","Deploying model access to one specific region only. Ensures data residency compliance but sacrifices throughput and failover benefits."
"Use case submission","Required form for some models","One-time form required by some vendors (e.g., Anthropic) describing your intended use case. Must be approved before model access is granted."
"Prompt logging","Recording of model inputs","The practice of logging prompts sent to a model. Bedrock policy: no prompt/completion logging, no model training on customer data."
"Model training restriction","Prohibition on using data for training","Common license clause preventing vendors from using your prompts/data to improve their models. Bedrock enforces this for all models."
"Attribution requirement","Credit to original creators","License requirement to credit the original model creators when using or distributing. Common in open-source licenses like Apache 2.0."
"Competitive restriction","Prohibition on competitive use","License clause preventing use of a model to train or improve competing models. Common in Llama and proprietary licenses."
"Knowledge cutoff","Model training data end date","The date up to which a model was trained on data. Affects the model's knowledge of recent events. E.g., Claude 3.5: ~Apr 2024."
