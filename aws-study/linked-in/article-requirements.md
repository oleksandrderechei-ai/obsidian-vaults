# LinkedIn Post Best Practices

## Format & Length

- 1,300 characters (sweet spot) – long enough for value, short enough to read
- 3,000 char max for articles, but posts outperform articles 3x
- "See more" hook – first 2-3 lines visible before fold
- Line breaks – one idea per line, lots of white space
- No links in post body – kills reach 50%+ (put in comments)
- Use emojis to highlight section headings in the post
- Do not use markdown formatting – LinkedIn does not render it

## Structure

```text
Hook line (curiosity/controversy/insight)
↓
Blank line
↓
3-5 bullet points or numbered list
↓
Blank line
↓
Key insight / contrarian take
↓
Blank line
↓

Hashtags (3-5 max)
```

## What Performs

- Personal experience > generic advice
- Contrarian takes – "Everyone says X, but actually Y"
- Specific numbers – "$14K vs $60K/month" > "cheaper"
- Lessons learned – "After 6 months with Bedrock, here's what I learned"
- Carousels – 10 slides, 1 idea per slide (highest engagement)

## Engagement Signals

- Comments > Likes > Shares for algorithm
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour
- Post timing: Tue-Thu, 8-10am local time
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant, mix niche (#AWSBedrock) + broad (#AI)
