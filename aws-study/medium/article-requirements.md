# Medium Article Best Practices

## Format & Length

- 1,500–2,500 words (7-10 min read) performs best for engagement
- Subheadings every 300 words – improves scannability
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Images/diagrams – 1 per 300-500 words increases retention
- Code blocks – use sparingly, explain before/after

## Structure

- Hook in first 2 sentences – Medium shows preview, must grab attention
- Clear problem statement – "Here's what most people get wrong..."
- Actionable takeaways – numbered lists, checklists
- Strong conclusion – summarize key points, call-to-action

## SEO & Discovery

### SEO Title

- Used in place of Title on search engine results pages (e.g., Google)
- **60 chars max** – titles over 60 characters will be truncated
- **40-50 chars optimal** – best click-through rates with commonly searched words
- Include primary keyword

### SEO Description

- Used in place of Subtitle on search engine results pages
- **140-156 chars optimal** – good SEO descriptions
- Utilize keywords, summarize the story
- Should entice clicks from search results

### Tags & Keywords

- 5 tags max – choose specific (AWS Bedrock) + broad (Cloud Computing)
- First 100 words – include main keywords naturally

## Engagement Signals

- Claps correlate with read time – keep readers scrolling
- Highlights – quotable sentences get shared
- Comments – end with a question to spark discussion
